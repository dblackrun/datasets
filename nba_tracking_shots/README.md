# NBA Tracking Shots

All shots taken against the Toronto Raptors in the 2019-20 NBA season with play-by-play features and full tracking filters added.

Data compiled from player tracking stats and play-by-play data on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/). All player, team and game ids are nba.com ids. Lineup ids are "-" separated player ids.

Tracking filters are added for each shot through a combination of programming logic and manual editing using [this tool](https://tracking.pbpstats.com/stats-nba-tracking-shots) available to [PBP Stats Tracking Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/pbpstats)
