# NBA Tracking Game Logs

Game logs with full tracking stats and possession counts for all games from the playoffs of the 2019-20 NBA season.

Data compiled from player tracking stats on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/). All player, team and game ids are nba.com ids. For definitions of individual stats check the [glossary](https://stats.nba.com/help/glossary/) on the NBA site.

Player possession counts are calculated from play-by-play data and are counted as the number of possessions for which the player was on the floor when the possession ended.

This data is available for download for all seasons since 2013-14 for [PBP Stats Tracking Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/pbpstats)
