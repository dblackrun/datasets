Data compiled from play-by-play data from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/).

All player, team and game ids are nba.com ids. Lineup ids are "-" separated player ids.

Manual tracking of shot data done using [this tool](https://tracking.pbpstats.com/shots/nba) available to [PBP Stats Tracking Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/pbpstats).

Manual stats include:

* whether the shot was wide open
* x, y coordinates of pass location (note that locations for passes from the backcourt will use coordinates around half court because the drawing of the court for adding the location does not show the backcourt)
* player id of passer
* seconds remaining on the shot clock
